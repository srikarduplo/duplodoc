Welcome to Duplo's documentation!
===============================================


What is Duplo:
==============
DuploCloud is a DevOps Robot. It is the subject matter expert in digital form. It is not a DevOps tool that requires a cloud expert to operate, but instead it is the cloud expert itself. The robot has a resume with over 500 skills that include AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Security and IOT among others. It allows users to build applications via a simple declarative interface and not have to deal with low level infrastructure details like VPC, security groups, IAM, Jenkins setup etc. These constructs are still in play, but Duplo software abstracts it away for you by auto-generating the configuration based on application needs.
